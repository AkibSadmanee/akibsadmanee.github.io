         This summer, my supervisor, Dr. Mahdi Belcaid, assigned me to mentor some high school students (grades 9-12) for two weeks. The task was to build a fully functional mobile app with them. Within those two weeks, I taught them everything from AWS and REST APIs to no-code programming.
     </p>

         I was super excited to teach them, and they far exceeded my expectations. They demonstrated impressive technical aptitude, innovative problem-solving skills, and a contagious enthusiasm for learning. Their ability to grasp complex concepts quickly and apply them creatively was truly inspiring.
     </p>

         It was super challenging. But in the end, we managed to build a fully functional app!!! It features AWS authentication, allows users to capture images of store receipts, extracts text from images using AI, and uses the ChatGPT API to structure the text! On the last day, the students showered me with their love, gratitude, and appreciation.
