     I recently defended my Master's Thesis at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. My research involved developing a novel interpretable text summarization method that reduces most of the problems introduced by the large language models (like chatGPT) while generating human-like summaries (currently waiting for publication). This concludes my Master's degree with a CGPA of 4.0 (on the scale of 4.0). My heartiest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Mahdi Belcaid, who has been a supportive pillar throughout the whole process.

     So.... What's next? <br> 
     I joined the same lab for a Ph.D. in Fall 2024. A new journey awaits. I'm super excited as there's so much to explore and learn!!!
