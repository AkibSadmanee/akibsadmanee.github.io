    My grandfather always said, “The light only increases when you light more candles with your fire.” That idea shapes everything I do. It pushes me to learn, to share, and to help others. It continues to fuel my passion for research, innovation, and discovery. I want to make a difference in the world, and I believe that research and teaching are the best way to do that. It's the reason I chose to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science. Ph.D. is not just a degree; it's a commitment to knowledge, a dedication to pushing the boundaries of what we know, and a promise to share that knowledge with others. I hope the journey will help me grow as an independent researcher and an excellent educator. In the future, I want to join the academia, teach people computer science and conduct my own research. I hope to advance the field of computer science, AI, and NLP while inspiring others to pursue their passions in science and technology.
