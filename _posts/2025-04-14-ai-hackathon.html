   <p>As a team of 4 interdeciplinary students (Business, Engineer, Biologist and Computer Scientist), we participated in the <a href="https://datascience.hawaii.edu/ai-hackathon/" target="_blank">Aloha Data AI Hackathon 2025</a>, which took place from April 4 to April 6, 2025. 
       The hackathon was organized by the Hawai'i Data Science Institute (Hi-DSI) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa to accelerate Hawaii’s resilience by fostering the development of innovative AI-powered solutions that enhance data integrity, visualization, and communication & education capabilities</p>
   <p>    
   Our team, Kani (“sound” in Hawaiian), took third place in the hackathon with a large language model chatbot that serves as a friendly guide for the Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal. 
   We shaped the bot’s answers by giving it clear step‑by‑step prompts using chain-of-thought prompting and a strict RAG system with appropriate tools. The experience helped us learn how to steer large language models with proper prompting startegies and make them do things in a strategic and controlled way.</p>
   
   The developed system can be found in the following link:
