   <p>As a team of 4 interdeciplinary students (Business, Engineer, Biologist and Computer Scientist), we participated in the <a href="https://datascience.hawaii.edu/ai-hackathon/" target="_blank">Aloha Data AI Hackathon 2025</a>, which took place from April 4 to April 6, 2025. 
       The hackathon was organized by the Hawai'i Data Science Institute (Hi-DSI) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa to accelerate Hawaii’s resilience by fostering the development of innovative AI-powered solutions that enhance data integrity, visualization, and communication & education capabilities</p>
   <p>    
   Our team, Kani (“sound” in Hawaiian), took third place in the hackathon with a large language model chatbot that serves as a friendly guide for the Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal. 
   We shaped the bot’s answers by giving it clear step‑by‑step prompts using chain-of-thought prompting and a strict RAG system with appropriate tools. The experience helped us learn how to steer large language models with proper prompting startegies and make them do things in a strategic and controlled way.</p>
   
   The developed system can be found in the following link:

    My grandfather always said, “The light only increases when you light more candles with your fire.” That idea shapes everything I do. It pushes me to learn, to share, and to help others. It continues to fuel my passion for research, innovation, and discovery. I want to make a difference in the world, and I believe that research and teaching are the best way to do that. It's the reason I chose to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science. Ph.D. is not just a degree; it's a commitment to knowledge, a dedication to pushing the boundaries of what we know, and a promise to share that knowledge with others. I hope the journey will help me grow as an independent researcher and an excellent educator. In the future, I want to join the academia, teach people computer science and conduct my own research. I hope to advance the field of computer science, AI, and NLP while inspiring others to pursue their passions in science and technology.

     I recently defended my Master's Thesis at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. My research involved developing a novel interpretable text summarization method that reduces most of the problems introduced by the large language models (like chatGPT) while generating human-like summaries (currently waiting for publication). This concludes my Master's degree with a CGPA of 4.0 (on the scale of 4.0). My heartiest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Mahdi Belcaid, who has been a supportive pillar throughout the whole process. 
   </p>
   <p>    
     So.... What's next? <br> 
     I joined the same lab for a Ph.D. in Fall 2024. A new journey awaits. I'm super excited as there's so much to explore and learn!!!

         This summer, my supervisor, Dr. Mahdi Belcaid, assigned me to mentor some high school students (grades 9-12) for two weeks. The task was to build a fully functional mobile app with them. Within those two weeks, I taught them everything from AWS and REST APIs to no-code programming.
     </p>
     <p>    
         I was super excited to teach them, and they far exceeded my expectations. They demonstrated impressive technical aptitude, innovative problem-solving skills, and a contagious enthusiasm for learning. Their ability to grasp complex concepts quickly and apply them creatively was truly inspiring.
     </p>
     <p>
         It was super challenging. But in the end, we managed to build a fully functional app!!! It features AWS authentication, allows users to capture images of store receipts, extracts text from images using AI, and uses the ChatGPT API to structure the text! On the last day, the students showered me with their love, gratitude, and appreciation.
