            <h3>Graduate Assistant, ICS Professional Certificate Program</h3>
            <p><strong>School of Information and Computer Science, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Fall 2025</p>
            <p>I am currently serving as a graduate assistant for the Graduate Certificate in Applied Computing with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. This program helps individuals from diverse backgrounds become comfortable with AI and potentially apply it in their own fields. My responsibilities include occasionally teaching classes, hosting review sessions to clarify course topics, designing assignments, and collaborating with faculty to develop curriculum that prepares students and working professionals for their future endeavors.</p>

            <h3>Mentor, LLM-based Chatbot for Legal form fill-up</h3>
            <p><strong>Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Summer 2025</p>
            <p>Another two-week internship with <a href="https://cds.coe.hawaii.edu/hokulani/" target="_blank">Project Hōkūlani</a> gave me the opportunity to mentor another cohort of high school students to develop an LLM-based chatbot. The app is designed to ask relevant questions to users in simple language in order to automatically fill out legal forms. The students learned to use Generative AI for coding in an ethical way. They also learned about prompt engineering and how to design effective prompts to get the desired output from the LLM. The final product is a web-based chatbot that can ask relevant questions to fill out legal forms or even explain terms to users in a simple language.</p>

            <h3>Mentor, AI-based Speech to text and Data processing</h3>
            <p><strong>Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Summer 2024</p>
            <p>During a two-week internship with <a href="https://cds.coe.hawaii.edu/hokulani/" target="_blank">Project Hōkūlani</a>, I had the opportunity to mentor a group of high school students to develop “Parrot Forms,” an AI system designed to automatically transcribe doctor-patient conversations, extract relevant medical information and populate the details directly into a mockup electronic medical record.</p>

            <h3>Assistant Mentor, Ethics and biases of AI</h3>
            
            <p><strong><a href="https://ai-4-all.org/" target="_blank">AI4all program, Discover AI</a></strong> - Spring 2023</p>
            <p>Designed and created content for a class of undergraduates who were learning about AI for the first time. Initiated and maintained discussion about the ethical use of AI and their biases. Helped the students find idea and dataset for a final project and also helped them through the project with weekly meetings, debugging and discussion sessions.</p>

            <h3>Mentor, AI-based mobile application</h3>
            <p><strong>Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Summer 2023</p>
            <p>During a two-week internship with <a href="https://cds.coe.hawaii.edu/hokulani/" target="_blank">Project Hōkūlani</a> at the University of Hawaiʻi, I had the pleasure of mentoring seven high school students who developed a mobile app called RESHEIPT to track expenses using AI. They learned to use AWS for authentication and storage, json data structure to handle data, how to do different types of API calls to the AWS server and how to use no-code platforms like Appgyver to build the app.</p>
