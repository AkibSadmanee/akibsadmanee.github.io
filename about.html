            <section class="introduction">
                <p>
                  My interest in technology began in my second year at Independent University, Bangladesh. I was excited by the idea that computers could learn to think on their own. This excitement led me to join the <a href="https://ccds.ai/" target="_blank">Center for Computational & Data Sciences Lab</a>, where I helped create a large collection of Bangla text and studied language technology for less-resourced languages. By the end of my undergraduate studies, I realized how much I loved working with language technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my undergraduate years, I worked on a project that used AI models to represent my native language as numerical vecotrs (word embeddings) for my thesis. This work led to my first publication in 2019 at an international conference, and it strengthened my passion for language technology. After earning my Bachelor’s in Computer Science with distinction, I continued with the same lab as a research assistant. I worked on a video captioning project where I built and improved parts of the system that processes language. This work taught me how to combine image analysis with language processing, handle challenging computer models, and work well with a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In search of more experience and to satiate my curiosity, I moved into the industry and worked as a Junior Machine Learning Engineer at the <a href="https://www.siliconorchard.com/" target="_blank">Silicon Orchard Ltd.</a> There, I built AI programs for real-world use, improved my Python and PyTorch skills, and learned how to create systems ready for production. I also helped with research on safe recommendation systems that protect user privacy, which taught me a lot about ethical AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2022, I started my master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, focusing on artificial intelligence. Working as a Teaching Assistant for subjects like algorithms and big data helped me improve my ability to explain complex ideas and mentor students. I also worked with high school students in the summers, which made me better at making complex topics easy to understand. I see these qualities as key for a successful academic career. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Graduate Research Assistant at SAIL with Dr. Mahdi Belcaid, I worked on new ways to pull useful information from text by combining modern language models with smart data extraction methods. The University of Hawai'i at Mānoa was a great place for my academic and personal growth. I enjoyed the friendly, collaborative spirit of the Information and Computer Sciences Department and the Hawai'i Data Science Institute. Working with experts from different fields, like biology and education, showed me how language technology can solve a variety of problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my journey, I have been driven by curiosity and a love of learning. My experiences—from doing basic research and writing papers, to creating AI solutions in the industry and helping students—have made me a dedicated researcher who loves to learn. Inspired by my grandfather’s saying, "the light only increases when you light more candles with yours," I always try to share what I know and make a positive impact in my community.
