<section class="introduction">
    <p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I have avid interest in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/nlp/#:~:text=Natural%20language%20processing%20(NLP)%20is,manipulate%2C%20and%20comprehend%20human%20language." target="_blank">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>, a subfield of artificial intelligence that makes computers understand human languages. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at <a href="https://mahdi-b.github.io/" target="_blank">Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab (SAIL)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://datascience.hawaii.edu/profile/mahdi-belcaid-2/" target="_blank">Dr. Mahdi Belcaid</a>.</p>
        
    <p>My research interest lies in structured multi-document text summarization - a subfield of NLP that focuses on generating concise and coherent summaries from a collection of documents. During my Ph.D. I want to create a robust system to generate automated literature reviews from scientific research papers that are not confined by the limitations of the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/" target="_blank">Large Language Models (LLMs).</a> In addition, I am also interested in AI ethics in NLP and the biases embedded in the LLMs.</p>
