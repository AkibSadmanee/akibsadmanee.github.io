        Hi, I'm Akib Sadmanee — a computer scientist with avid interest in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing" class="black-text">Natural Language Processing,</a> a field in computer science that makes computers understand human languages. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the daprtment of Information and Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa under <a href="https://datascience.hawaii.edu/fellows-progam/" class="black-text">the Hawai'i data science fellowship program</a> from the Change-HI project. My research focus is structured text summarization of topic specific multi-documents. This is an essential area of research within the field of natural language processing. It pertains to the task of generating a concise and coherent summary from a collection of documents that are focused on a particular subject matter. In our case, we are working with scientific research papers on various topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Multi-documents text summarization is substantially different from single document summarization. When working with text data from multiple documents, we need to consider some issues unique to multi-documents text summarization.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>Different opinions from different authors</h5>
        <p>Different research papers on the same topic may propose contradicting ideas. When summarizing the research papers, we can not say <i>A is True.</i> and <i>A is False.</i> without the context.</p>
        
        <h5>Same opinion in multiple documents</h5>
        <p>Different research papers may focus on the same topic. When writing a concise summary, we should not overwhelm the summary with similar Information.</p>

        <h5>Coherence between ideas</h5>
        <p>When multiple documents introduce multiple different ideas, it becomes really hard to maintain a harmonious coherence and logical flow between the ideas.</p>
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Thus, multi-documents text summarization can be considered more complicated than single document text summarization. Even though chatGPT is doing an incredible job at doing text summarization when the document is small enough. However, chatGPT still fails to summarize large volume of text from multiple text documents. Nor does it allow the user to have any control over what to include in the summary and what to exclude. This makes the research on multi-documents text summarization still an important problem to solve.</p>
