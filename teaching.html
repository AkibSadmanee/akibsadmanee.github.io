            <h3>Graduate Assistant, Graduate Certificate (GCERT) in Applied Computing: Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Track</h3>
            <p><strong>University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Fall 2025 - Current</p>
            <p>My role in this program is to mentor a diverse cohort of working professionals and students from different backgrounds - STEM to philosophy. I assist in delivering a curriculum focused on real-world applications of AI, helping the students level up and pivot into high-growth computing careers.</p>

            <h3>Assistant Mentor, Ethics and biases of AI</h3>
            
            <p><strong><a href="https://ai-4-all.org/" target="_blank">AI4all program, Discover AI</a></strong> - Spring 2023</p>
            <p>Designed and created content for a class of undergraduates who were learning about AI for the first time. Initiated and maintained discussions about the ethical use of AI and its biases. Helped the students find an idea and a dataset for a final project and also helped them through the project with weekly meetings, debugging and discussion sessions.</p>

            <h3>Mentor, AI-based mobile application</h3>
            <p><strong>Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Summer 2023</p>
            <p>During a two-week internship with <a href="https://cds.coe.hawaii.edu/hokulani/" target="_blank">Project Hōkūlani</a> at the University of Hawaiʻi, I had the pleasure of mentoring seven high school students who developed a mobile app called RESHEIPT to track expenses using AI. They learned to use AWS for authentication and storage, json data structure to handle data, how to do different types of API calls to the AWS server and how to use no-code platforms like Appgyver to build the app.</p>
