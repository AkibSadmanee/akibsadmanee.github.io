            <h3>Mentor, AI-based Speach to text and Data processing</h3>
            <p><strong>Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Summer 2024</p>
            <p>During a two-week internship with <a href="https://cds.coe.hawaii.edu/hokulani/" target="_blank">Project Hōkūlani</a>, I had the opportunity to mentor a group of high school students to develop “Parrot Forms,” an AI system designed to automatically transcribe doctor-patient conversations, extract relevant medical information and populate the details directly into a mockup electronic medical record.</p>

            <h3>Assistant Mentor, Ethics and biases of AI</h3>
            
            <p><strong><a href="https://ai-4-all.org/" target="_blank">AI4all program, Discover AI</a></strong> - Spring 2023</p>
            <p>Designed and created content for a class of undergraduates who were learning about AI for the first time. Initiated and maintained discussion about the ethical use of AI and their biases. Helped the students find idea and dataset for a final project and also helped them through the project with weekly meetings, debugging and discussion sessions.</p>

            <h3>Mentor, AI-based mobile application</h3>
            <p><strong>Scalable Analytics and Informatics Lab, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</strong> - Summer 2023</p>
            <p>During a two-week internship with <a href="https://cds.coe.hawaii.edu/hokulani/" target="_blank">Project Hōkūlani</a> at the University of Hawaiʻi, I had the pleasure of mentoring seven high school students who developed a mobile app called RESHEIPT to track expenses using AI. They learned to use AWS for authentication and storage, json data structure to handle data, how to do different types of API calls to the AWS server and how to use no-code platforms like Appgyver to build the app.</p>
